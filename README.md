# thinkingearth-hackathon-track1

This repo contains resources for track 1 of the [ThinkingEarth Hackathon](https://thinkingearth-hackathon.devpost.com/?_gl=1*u5l5q*_ga*MTU5NDcyMTA0My4xNzUwMDg1MDYw) at [BiDS 25](https://www.bigdatafromspace2025.org/satellite-event-submission), which targets at exploring the usage of Earth observation (EO) foundation models. 

## Tasks
Select or customize one specific topic, then complete one project related to one or more EO foundation models (e.g., [CopernicusFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11849), [DOFA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15356)). You may explore fine-tuning strategies, adapt models across geographies or modalities, identify limitations, develop novel use cases related to EO applications, or any other interesting ideas. 

Visit the [hackathon page](https://thinkingearth-hackathon.devpost.com/?_gl=1*u5l5q*_ga*MTU5NDcyMTA0My4xNzUwMDg1MDYw) for detailed organization information.

## Submissions
Participants must submit the following materials through the dedicated platform by the end of the development phase:
- Project description outlining the problem addressed, approach taken, and relevance to the selected track
- Source code used to develop the solution (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, scripts, or repositories)
- Documentation explaining how to run the code, key methods used, and any dependencies or requirements
- Demo or presentation materials showcasing the solution and its functionality (e.g., slides, short video, screenshots)

A convenient way is to create a github repo with all the required materials and share the link in your submission:
- a README.md file containing project description, code documentation, and access to the presentations
- source codes
- presentation or link to the presentation

## Judging Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of four expert judges based on:
- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Novelty
- Clarity
- Impact potential

### Introduction to EO foundation models

In short, EO foundation models are neural network backbones (e.g. ResNet, ViT) pretrained on big EO data (usually in a self-supervised manner without labels), which can then be transferred to various downstream tasks through fine tuning or other task-specific strategies.

See the webinar on September 3rd at 10:00 AM CEST for an official introduction. Slides will be available [here](https://example.com).

### Demo notebooks

Here we prepare some demo jupyter notebooks playing with example EO foundation models.
- Partial tuning (freeze encoder) on classification downstream task: `track1_demo1_classification.ipynb`
- Partial tuning on segmentation/regression downstream task: `track1_demo2_segmentation.ipynb`
- Simple parameter-efficient fine tuning (LoRA): `track1_demo3_PEFT.ipynb`
- Simple image retrieval: `track1_demo4_retrieval.ipynb`
